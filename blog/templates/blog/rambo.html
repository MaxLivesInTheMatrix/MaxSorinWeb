        <p>My bird, Rambo, would always land on the side of his fountain and wait for me to plug it in so water would run. Instead 
            of having him wait all the time, I made the fountain capacitive touch, so that when he lands on it, he can drink! Running
            the fountain all the time not only wasted energy and splashed water everywhere, but I was also worried about the longevity
            of the cheap water pump inside the fountain. This simple project made life better for my birdie and myself!
        </p>

            The methodology here was straighforward. The system would remain plugged into the wall at all times, however there is a mosfet 
            blocking current until it is activated by the capacitive touch. Rambo's feet are like the "signal" wire of a relay.
