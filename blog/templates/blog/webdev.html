        <p>This website was created to showcase some entry level web development skills and mainly a place to store personal projects. My entire 
            career has been in embedded electronics, so this was definitely out of my comfort zone.
            There was a lot of effort and small quirks that went into the site. By far my favorite are 
            the spinning logos of LinkedIn, LeetCode, and GitHub when you hover over them with a mouse.
